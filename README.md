# Weather App
A dynamic and modern weather app built using an API key from WeatherAPI and coded via Visual Studio 2022.


Initially started as a small task while at my IT internship at Business Solutions, I decided to ignore what the rest of my internship students were doing, and I decided to go full-throttle with this WeatherApp. I am proud of my creation, still refining it, but it came such a long way. Went from it being such a simple API for displaying weather for cities across the globe, into transforming it into a full-blown professional weather app, able to show 3-day forecasts, 24-hour forecasts, UV index, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, dew point, air quality, a refresh button and an auto-refresh feature, that refreshes the site every 5-minutes, dark/light theme toggle, toggle between fahrenheit/celsius, dynamic weather backgrounds, real-time clock, and the ability to share the weather to anybody on the web!

My proudest feature was implementing leaflet.js into the API, and coded it into making it automatically hover over a specific location. You search for Baghdad for example? It will hover over Baghdad. Sydney, New York, Buenos Aires, no matter, it will hover over automatically.

The map is now fully available via the Azure Cloud, finally released it from its Umbraco reins, and you can use it for yourself via this link https://myweatherappdeployed-hmdmgmeccgejfbat.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/?city=

I am constantly updating the Weather App daily, so, not everything will be perfect. Still polishing the UI and soon will add more features in. In the meantime? Enjoy it.
