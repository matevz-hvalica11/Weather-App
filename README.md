🌦️ Weather App
A dynamic, modern weather application built with WeatherAPI and developed in Visual Studio 2022.

🚀 Project Origin
What started as a small internship task at Business Solutions quickly became a passion project. While others stayed within the brief, I went full‑throttle — transforming a simple weather display into a feature‑rich, professional‑grade app.

✨ Features
Forecasts → 3‑day and 24‑hour views

Live Data → UV index, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, dew point, air quality

Controls → Manual refresh & auto‑refresh (every 5 minutes)

Personalization → Light/dark theme toggle, °C/°F switch

Dynamic UX → Weather‑based background changes, real‑time clock

Sharing → One‑click weather sharing across the web

Interactive Map → Integrated with leaflet.js to auto‑hover over searched locations (e.g., Baghdad, Sydney, Buenos Aires)

☁️ Cloud Deployment
Hosted on Azure Cloud — globally accessible, scalable, and future‑ready. 🔗 Live app: https://myweatherappdeployed-hmdmgmeccgejfbat.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/?city=
(Highly recommend keeping the Page Zoom at 100% for the best viewing experience)
