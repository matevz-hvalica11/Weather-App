# Weather-App
A dynamic and modern weather app built using WeatherAPI and coded via Visual Studio 2022.


Initially started as a small task while at my IT internship at Business Solutions, I decided to ignore what the rest of my internship students were doing, and I decided to go full-throttle with this WeatherApp. I am proud of my creation, still refining it, but it came such a long way. Went from it being such a simple API for displaying weather for cities across the globe, into transforming it into a full-blown professional weather app, able to show 3-day forecasts, hourly-forecasts, precipitation, UV index, wind speed, refresh button and auto-refresh every 5-minutes, dark/light theme toggle, toggle between fahrenheit/celsius and the ability to share the weather to anybody on the web!

My proudest feature was implementing leaflet.js, an interactive map, and I coded it, so when you search for "Miami" as an example, it INSTANTLY hovers over Miami on the map! Press on any location on the world map, and it will INSTANTLY give you weather data!

I am proud of my creation, and while I did not TRULY do it alone (hahaha), Copilot helped out a ton, I was STILL the one debugging like crazy, pushing through setbacks, refining the code, and celebrating the victories. So, don't think it was just a "CTRL + A" + "CTRL + C" + "CTRL + V" type of ordeal. Nope!

Go ahead, enjoy it. The app is accessible via Umbraco, but I am working on making it a standalone app.
